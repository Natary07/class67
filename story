Once upon a time, in a jungle there lived a Tortoise and a Hare. 
The two animals raced one another to see who was faster. 
The Hare challanged the Tortoise to see who was faster, and the Tortoise accepted the challenge.
As the race started the Hare raced past the Tortoise, and had a big lead on him.
The Hare continued running at a much faster pace, and eventually won the race.
Morale: 
Confidence and consistency wins the race.
