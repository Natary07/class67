Once upon a time, in a jungle there lived a Tortoise and a Hare. 
The two animals raced one another to see who was faster. 
The Hare challanged the Tortoise to see who was faster, and the Tortoise accepted the challenge.
As the race started the Hare raced past the Tortoise, and had a big lead on him.
After running for some time the Tortoise thought it would be good to stop and take a nap
because he thought the Tortoise was very slow and would never catch up.
The Hare woke up after a while to see that the Tortoise was almost at the finish; 
the Hare tried to catch up to win the race but could not. The Tortoise won the race 
agaisnt the hair. 
Morale: 
Slow and steady wins the race.
